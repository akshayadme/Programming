Signs attributable to subacute sclerosing panencephalitis usually develop 4-8 years after the onset of measles infection. It is not precisely known how the measles virus remains dormant for so many years and why it becomes active again. More recent data indicate that it can follow acute measles infection in 1:10,000 cases. The incidence of SSPE is inversely related to measles vaccination coverage. In the developed world, the prevalence of SSPE has steadily declined since the introduction of the measles virus vaccine. The characteristic clinical manifestations of SSPE include behavioral abnormalities, cognitive decline, myoclonic jerks, seizures and abnormalities in vision. Clinical manifestations of SSPE usually start with subtle intellectual deterioration of the affected child causing deterioration in school performance. One of the most characteristic manifestations of SSPE is periodic myoclonic jerks that often leads to difficulty in walking and repeated falls. In the terminal stages of the disease, decerebrate and decorticate rigidity appear. Ultimately the patient becomes vegetative. Management of the disease includes seizure control and avoidance of secondary complications associated with the progressive disability.

The identification of HIV as the causative agent of AIDS catalyzed efforts to develop antiviral agents. The licenced anti-HIV drugs fall into some categories: reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs), integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion inhibitors (FIs), and coreceptor inhibitors. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as the standard of care for the treatment of HIV infection was seminal in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection and progression to AIDS.

Its prevalence is relatively rare in developed countries but more common in South America and East Africa. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the predominant tumor type in penile cancer, accounting for 95% of cases. Penile cancers are thought to arise from the progression of precursor lesions and can be subdivided into human papilloma virus (HPV) positive and HPV negative cases. Most common disrupted pathways, both in HPV-mediated and HPV-independent penile carcinogenesis, involve the p14ARF/MDM2/p53 and/or p16INK4a/cyclin D/Rb pathways. HPVs exert their oncogenic effect by expressing the oncoproteins E6 and E7, which bind to and inactivate the p53 and Rb tumor suppressor gene products, respectively. HPV independent mechanisms of pathway inactivation include silencing of the p16INK4a gene by promoter hypermethylation, somatic mutations of the p53 gene, over-expression of MDM2 and mutation of p14ARF. Several other molecular events include alterations in the activity and/or expression of ras and myc genes, cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX) pathway and prostaglandin E2 synthase.

As with BCC, risk for development of SCC is strongly influenced by the nature and dose of UV radiation and genetic backgrounds that regulate that interaction. Mutations in TP53 have been described in actinic keratoses, in situ SCC, and invasive SCC with UV signature lesions common, and a reported mutation rate as high as 45%. As with TP53, UV-induced mutations in HRAS and KRAS have also been characterized in both actinic keratoses and SCC. The reported frequency of RAS mutations in SCCs ranges from approximately 10% to almost 50%. Several recent studies have also reported mutations of p16 in up to 24% of SCCs.

Its prevalence is relatively rare in developed countries but more common in South America and East Africa. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the predominant tumor type in penile cancer, accounting for 95% of cases. Penile cancers are thought to arise from the progression of precursor lesions and can be subdivided into human papilloma virus (HPV) positive and HPV negative cases. Most common disrupted pathways, both in HPV-mediated and HPV-independent penile carcinogenesis, involve the p14ARF/MDM2/p53 and/or p16INK4a/cyclin D/Rb pathways. HPVs exert their oncogenic effect by expressing the oncoproteins E6 and E7, which bind to and inactivate the p53 and Rb tumor suppressor gene products, respectively. HPV independent mechanisms of pathway inactivation include silencing of the p16INK4a gene by promoter hypermethylation, somatic mutations of the p53 gene, over-expression of MDM2 and mutation of p14ARF.

The cause of SD is unknown and the disease seems to be multifactorial. Malassezia yeasts are considered to play an important role. They cause an inflammatory reaction that seems to be mediated by free fatty acids, released from sebaceous triglycerides by fungal enzymes such as lipases. The lipid layer of Malassezia can also modulate pro-inflammatory cytokine production by keratinocytes. Although it can be associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection and neurologic disease (e.g., cerebrovascular event, Parkinson disease), SD typically occurs in healthy persons. Its prevalence is 1% to 3% in the general population and 34% to 83% in immunocompromised persons.

Two types of HIV has been characterized. HIV-1 is the most virulent and pathogenic strain. Worldwide, the predominant virus is HIV-1. The relatively uncommon HIV-2 type is concentrated in West Africa and is rarely found elsewhere. Infection with HIV occurs by transfer of blood, semen, and breast milk. The identification of HIV as the causative agent of AIDS catalyzed efforts to develop antiviral agents. The licenced anti-HIV drugs fall into some categories: reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs), integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion inhibitors (FIs), and coreceptor inhibitors. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as the standard of care for the treatment of HIV infection was seminal in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection and progression to AIDS. Combination antiretroviral therapy dramatically suppresses HIV replication and reduces the plasma HIV-1 viral load, resulting in significant reconstitution of the immune system.}]"

Evidence indicates that KS progression occurs upon the deregulated expression of anti-apoptotic genes (Bcl-2), oncogenes (c-myc, c-int, ras) and oncosuppressor genes (TP53), and is associated with the long-lasting expression of HHV8 latency genes (LANA, v-cyc D, v-FLIP, Kaposin). All these genes are, in fact, expressed or altered in most KS spindle cells in the nodular-late stage of KS. Bcl-2 acts as a major KS progression factor, and TP53 and c-myc may also have a role in disease progression. HHV8 latency gene products may be involved in KS progression due to their capability of promoting cell growth by direct effects or antiapoptotic effects.}]"

The cause of SD is unknown and the disease seems to be multifactorial. Malassezia yeasts are considered to play an important role. They cause an inflammatory reaction that seems to be mediated by free fatty acids, released from sebaceous triglycerides by fungal enzymes such as lipases. The lipid layer of Malassezia can also modulate pro-inflammatory cytokine production by keratinocytes. Although it can be associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection and neurologic disease (e.g., cerebrovascular event, Parkinson disease), SD typically occurs in healthy persons.

However, these examinations can only be detectable when ASO already developed, and there was no predictable markers for ASO in its earlier stages. Recent studies have reported that some micro RNAs could be serum markers for early-stage ASO.}]"

Its major characteristics include a variable degree of airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5. The activation of eosinophils leads to release of toxic granules and oxygen free radicals that lead to tissue damage and promote the development of chronic inflammation.}]"

"[{""ko"":T10006,""name"":Weight Loss},{},{""ko"":H01645,""name"":Hyperthyroidism,""description"":Hyperthyroidism is a pathological disorder characterised by increased thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion from the thyroid gland. The term thyrotoxicosis is not synonymous with hyperthyroidism. Thyrotoxicosis is defined as the clinical syndrome of hypermetabolism resulting from increased thyroid hormone levels, irrespective of the source. The causes of hyperthyroidism include Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and solitary toxic adenoma. Less common causes of hyperthyroidism include thyrotropin-induced thyrotoxicosis and trophoblastic tumours. The causes of thyrotoxicosis without hyperthyroidism are less common and generally transient. In patients with silent thyroiditis, post-partum thyroiditis, or subacute painful thyroiditis, the destruction of thyrocytes leads to release of preformed hormones into the circulation. Drug-induced thyrotoxicosis has the same pathogenic mechanism as thyroiditis. Exogenous thyrotoxicosis develops after ingestion of excessive amounts of thyroid hormone, and is associated with low serum thyroglobulin concentrations. Patients of hyperthyroidism/thyrotoxicosis usually have fatigue, nervousness or anxiety, weight loss, palpitations, and heat sensitivity. Clinical findings almost always include tachycardia, warm moist skin, the presence of an enlarged thyroid, and a slight tremor. The three options for treating patients with hyperthyroidism are antithyroid drugs (ATDs), radioactive iodine ablation, and surgery. All three therapeutic options would be effective in the treatment of patients with Graves' disease, whereas patients with toxic adenoma or toxic multinodular goiter should have either radioactive iodine therapy or surgery, since these patients rarely go into remission. In patients with toxic nodular goiter, ATDs are generally used to restore euthyroidism before definitive treatment with surgery or radioactive iodine, and infrequently used as long-term treatment when the other two therapies are contraindicated or the patient has a short life expectancy.}]"
