"[{""ko"":H01580,""name"":Vitamin C deficiency,""description"":Scurvy occurs because of reduced intake or absorption of vitamin C, which is characterized by bleeding gums, impaired wound healing, petechiae, perifollicular hemorrhage, anemia, arthralgia and joint effusions, fatigue, depression, and sudden death. It appears to result primarily from the decreased synthesis of collagen, a major protein in the body dependent on vitamin C for its biosynthesis. However, this role of vitamin C does not explain all of the manifestations associated with scurvy. At-risk groups include the poor (because of reduced access to groceries), food faddists, and individuals with purported allergies to multiple fruit and vegetable products. Other at-risk groups include persons with gastrointestinal disease (e.g. colitis), anatomical abnormalities, poor dentition, cancer patients on chemotherapy, patients on hemodialysis, and psychiatric disorders (e.g. depression, schizophrenia, or anorexia). Alcoholic persons represent one of the largest groups at risk for scurvy because they may have poorly balanced diets and because alcohol decreases the absorption of vitamin C. The diagnosis of scurvy is generally based on clinical features and dietary history, and there is rapid resolution of signs and symptoms after vitamin C supplementation.},{},{""ko"":D00018,""name"":Ascorbic acid}]"

It can originate from and cause damage to the microvasculature, which if sufficiently severe, can produce organ dysfunction. DIC is not a disease entity on itself but is always associated to an underlying disease. The clinical conditions that may be associated with DIC include sepsis, trauma, malignancy, liver disease, obstetric disorders, envenomation, vascular anomalies, and major transfusion reactions. A diagnosis of DIC should be made only in the presence of a clinical condition (causative factor) supported by repeated laboratory tests for coagulation profile and clotting factors. Treatment of DIC is aimed at combating the underlying disorder followed by supportive management.},{},{""ko"":D02112,""name"":Heparin sodium}]"

Oncogenic NRAS mutations activate both effector pathways Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt. The Raf-MEK-ERK pathway may also be activated via mutations in the BRAF gene. The PI3K-Akt pathway may be activated through loss or mutation of the inhibitory tumor suppressor gene PTEN. These mutations arise early during melanoma pathogenesis and are preserved throughout tumor progression. Melanoma development has been shown to be strongly associated with inactivation of the p16INK4a/cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6/retinoblastoma protein (p16INK4a/CDK4,6/pRb) and p14ARF/human double minute 2/p53 (p14ARF/HMD2/p53) tumor suppressor pathways.

The pain of CH is associated with ipsilateral conjunctival injection, lacrimation, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, forehead and facial sweating, miosis, ptosis and/or eyelid edema, and/or restlessness or agitation. Headaches often recur at the same time each day during the cluster period, which can last for weeks to months. CH occurs more commonly in male patients (2.5:1 to 4.3:1 male to female) with an average age of onset in the third or fourth decade. The pathophysiology of CH is not fully understood, but may include a genetic component. Treatment focuses on avoiding triggers and includes abortive therapies, prophylaxis during the cluster period, and long-term treatment in patients with chronic CH. Evidence supports the use of supplemental oxygen, sumatriptan, and zolmitriptan for acute treatment of episodic CH. Verapamil is used to treat chronic CH. More invasive treatments, including nerve stimulation and surgery, may be helpful in refractory cases.},{},{""ko"":D00676,""name"":Sumatriptan succinate}]"

The malformation brings about high morbidity and mortality, thus requiring the utilization of an adequate surgical technique for its correction. The genetic mechanism responsible of tricuspid atresia is still obscure.

In contrast, sporadic BL (sBL) among adolescents in Europe and North America are mostly EBV-negative. A third type of BL is associated with HIV-infection in adults. All of these subtypes possess chromosomal rearrangements of the c-myc oncogene, the genetic hallmark of BL that contributes to lymphomagenesis through alterations in cell cycle regulation, cellular differentiation, apoptosis, cellular adhesion, and metabolism. Many BL carry point mutation in the p53 tumor suppressor gene or other defects in the p14ARF-MDM2-p53 pathway, and inactivation of the p16INK4a gene by promoter methylation or homozygous deletion. This indicates that disruption of both the pRb and p53 tumor suppressor pathways is critical for BL development.},{},{""ko"":D00287,""name"":Cyclophosphamide}]"

COPD is associated with underlying inflammation in response to chronic exposure to noxious particulates and gases and with a number of comorbid conditions. The onset of COPD generally occurs in the 6th to 8th decades of life. Early onset COPD is defined as disease onset before the age of 50 years, irrespective of smoking history. The presence of persons with early onset, severely reduced pulmonary function suggests that individuals may vary in their genetic susceptibility to the effects of smoking. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is the only proven genetic risk factor for COPD. Bronchodilators are the mainstay of treatment since they improve lung function and reduce acute exacerbations. Long-acting inhaled bronchodilators are recommended as first line treatment for patients with persistent symptoms.},{},{""ko"":D10020,""name"":Olodaterol hydrochloride}]"

Some osteopetrotic conditions exhibit additional clinical features including renal tubular acidosis and secondary neurological impairment. In forms of osteopetrosis with normal osteoclast counts, most of the mutated genes encode proteins that regulate the intra- and extracellular pH of osteoclasts, such as TCIRG1 gene encoding for the a3 subunit of the V-ATPase and CLCN7 gene. In cases with decreased osteoclast counts, osteoclast differentiation is impaired by mutations in RANKL or RANK. These RANK-deficient patients could be rescued by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.},{},{""ko"":D00747,""name"":Interferon gamma-1b}]"
"[{""ko"":H01510,""name"":Malignant paraganglioma,""description"":Paragangliomas (PGLs) are rare neuroendocrine tumors that arise in sympathetic and parasympathetic paraganglia and derive from neural crest cells. Malignancy is defined by presence of metastases, tumor spread in sites where chromaffin tissue is normally absent such as lymph nodes, liver, lungs, and bones. Malignant PGLs are extremely rare. The pathogenesis and progression of PGLs are very strongly influenced by genetics. A germline mutation in one of the susceptibility genes identified so far explains ~40% of all cases; the remaining 60% are thought to be sporadic cases. Sporadic as well as hereditary PGLs have been divided in two main clusters linked to two different signalling pathways: the first cluster contains all VHL-, SDHx-, and FH- mutated tumors and is associated to the activation of hypoxic pathway, while the second cluster contains all RET- , NF1-, MAX and TMEM127- mutated tumors and is associated to the activation of MAPK and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathways.},{},{""ko"":D03308,""name"":Iobenguane I 131}]"

Patients with TSC are frequently diagnosed with comorbid neurological disorders, including epilepsy, intellectual disability, behavioral dysregulation, sleep disorders, and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). TSC most often results from spontaneous genetic mutations in one or two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, which encode hamartin and tuberin, respectively. These gene products form a physical and functional complex to limit activation of the mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1. When these genes are deficient, mTOR complex 1 is constitutively up-regulated, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and protein synthesis.},{},{""ko"":D10915,""name"":Cannabidiol}]"

TSC is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by inactivating mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. These mutations lead to constitutive upregulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which affects many cellular processes involved in tumor growth. Clinical studies have demonstrated that mTOR inhibitors can induce regression of SEGA in patients with TSC, providing a viable alternative to surgical removal.},{},{""ko"":D02714,""name"":Everolimus}]"

However, because of the association with other autoimmune diseases, the presence of autoantibodies, and response to immunosuppressive medication, they are believed to be autoimmune in origin.

However, later studies confirmed that most patients with primary aldosteronism are normokalemic. The prevalence of primary aldosteronism among nonselected hypertensive persons is between 5% and 13%, and it is now recognized to be the most common form of secondary hypertension. There are the seven subtypes of primary aldosteronism. Aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) and bilateral idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA) are the most common subtypes of primary aldosteronism. Unilateral adrenal hyperplasia, aldosterone-producing adrenocortical carcinoma, ectopic aldosterone-producing adenoma, and familial hyperaldosteronism (type I and typeII) are unusual subtypes. Somatic mutations in KCNJ5, ATP1A1, ATP2B3, and CACNA1D have been described in APAs.

Traditionally, endogenous CS is classified as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-dependent (about 80%) or ACTH- independent (about 20%). Among ACTH-dependent forms, pituitary corticotroph adenoma (Cushing's disease) is most common. Most pituitary tumors are sporadic, resulting from monoclonal expansion of a single mutated cell. Recently recurrent activating somatic driver mutations in the ubiquitin-specific protease 8 gene (USP8) were identified in almost half of corticotroph adenoma. Germline mutations in MEN1 (encoding menin), AIP (encoding aryl-hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein), PRKAR1A (encoding cAMP-dependent protein kinase type I alpha regulatory subunit) and CDKN1B (encoding cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B; also known as p27 Kip1) have been identified in familial forms of pituitary adenomas. However, the frequency of familial pituitary adenomas is less than 5% in patients with pituitary adenomas. Among ACTH-independent CS, adrenal adenoma is most common.

Germline mutations in MEN1 (encoding menin), AIP (encoding aryl-hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein), PRKAR1A (encoding cAMP-dependent protein kinase type I alpha regulatory subunit) and CDKN1B (encoding cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B; also known as p27 Kip1) have been identified in familial forms of pituitary adenomas. However, the frequency of familial pituitary adenomas is less than 5% in patients with pituitary adenomas. Among ACTH-independent CS, adrenal adenoma is most common.

"[{""ko"":H01431,""name"":Cushing syndrome,""description"":Cushing syndrome (CS) is a rare disorder resulting from prolonged exposure to excess glucocorticoids via exogenous and endogenous sources. The typical clinical features of CS are related to hypercortisolism and include accumulation of central fat, moon facies, neuromuscular weakness, osteoporosis or bone fractures, metabolic complications, and mood changes. Traditionally, endogenous CS is classified as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-dependent (about 80%) or ACTH- independent (about 20%).

"[{""ko"":H01267,""name"":Familial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia,""description"":Familial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HHF) is the most common cause of persistent hypoglycemia in infancy. Recent studies on the molecular basis of the disease have disclosed specific genetic defects in the regulation of insulin secretion. Seven different loci have been associated with hyperinsulinism: ABCC8, KCNJ11, HADHSC, GCK, GLUD1, SLC16A1, and INSR. Mutations of these loci have significant differences in phenotype and inheritance pattern. The most common genes associated with hyperinsulinism, involve the ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes that encode the two subunits of the beta-cell ATP-dependent potassium channel. Recessive mutations of these genes cause a severe form of neonatal hypoglycemia that frequently requires near-total pancreatectomy. Diazoxide, a drug that acts as an agonist of the ATP-dependent potassium channel to suppress insulin secretion, is effective in defects associated with mutations of GLUD1 and HADHSC. Diazoxide is often ineffective in mutations of the ATP- dependent potassium channel and may not adequately control hypoglycemia in GCK or SLC16A1 mutations.},{},{""ko"":D00294,""name"":Diazoxide}]"

"[{""ko"":H01658,""name"":Microscopic polyangiitis,""description"":Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) is an idiopathic autoimmune disease characterized by systemic vasculitis. MPA predominantly affects small-calibre blood vessels and is associated with the presence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA). The association with ANCAs originally defined the group of ANCA-associated vasculitides, comprising granulomatosis with polyangitis (GPA, formerly known as Wegener granulomatosis) [DS:H01655], microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA, formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome) [DS:H01468], which have different frequencies of ANCA-positivity. ANCA in MPA are predominantly directed against myeloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA) but may, in a minority of patients, be directed against proteinase 3 (PR3-ANCA). Not all patients, however, have ANCA. MPA is clinically characterized by small-vessel vasculitis primarily affecting the kidneys and the lungs but other organs may be involved as well. Renal involvement, which can be the only manifestation, is clinically apparent as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and histopathologically as pauci-immune necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis. Diagnosis is mainly established by clinical manifestations, computed tomography (TC), ANCA antibody detection, and renal and pulmonary biopsy. The introduction of aggressive immunosuppressive treatment has substantially improved the prognosis. The standardized therapeutic regimen is based on cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids. Using this regimen, remission can be achieved in most of the patients. Rituximab may represent an important alternative to cyclophosphamide for patients who may not respond adequately to antimetabolite therapies.},{},{""ko"":D02994,""name"":Rituximab}]"

Nearly all (90 %) of WNT patients have somatic missense mutations in CTNNB1 which promote protein stabilization. Alterations in SHH subgroup most often fall within the Shh signalling pathway. The most common are somatic or germline inactivating alterations or loss of PTCH1 and SUFU, or somatic missense mutations activating SMO. Group 3 tumors are characterized by MYC amplification resulting in high MYC mRNA expression levels compared with SHH and Group 4 tumors.The most frequently mutated somatic gene in Group 4 medulloblastoma is KDM6A, a histone H3 Lys27 (H3K27) demethylase.},{},{""ko"":D00254,""name"":Carmustine}]"

The blood supply to the pulmonary arteries is provided by a patent arterial duct or by major aorto pulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs). Two-thirds of the cases with pulmonary atresia are associated with MAPCAs, which can vary greatly in number and site of origin. PA-VSD shares similarities with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and has been considered a severe end of the spectrum of TOF. Although surgical interventions have been employed successfully for a number of years, the long-term prognosis has remained poor with an increased incidence of sudden death. An association between conotruncal cardiac abnormalities and 22q11.2 deletion during fetal life has been investigated and reported to occur in 20% of cases of PA-VSD.},{},{""ko"":D00180,""name"":Alprostadil}]"

Although it is initially and adaptive response to a variety of stimuli resulting mainly in extracellular hypocalcaemia (vitamin D deficiency, chronic kidney disease, idiopathic hypercalciuria, calcium malabsorption), long-standing SHPT may eventually develop into autonomous HPT (ie, tertiary HPT).

The major symptoms of psoriasis are itchy, scaly, and flaky skin, swelling, pain, and disfiguring skin lesions. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form. Other forms include flexural, guttate, nail, inverse psoriasis, erythroderma, and psoriatic arthritis. Nail psoriasis can accompany any form of psoriasis or occur of its own accord. It can occur in any age group, but psoriatic arthritis usually develops between the ages of 30-50 years. Various factors such as bacterial infection, genetic and environmental factors, and immune disorders play an important role in causing psoriasis. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with genetic predisposition, but no distinct immunogen has been identified. The presence of cytokines, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions has prompted the development of biologic therapies. The diagnosis is usually clinical, based on the presence of typical erythematous scaly patches, papules, and plaques that are often pruritic and sometimes painful. Biopsy is rarely needed to confirm the diagnosis. First-line therapies for most patients are topical treatments such as topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs. For those with more severe or treatment-resistant disease, second- or third-line therapies include phototherapy, systemic therapies such as methotrexate, and more recently biologic therapies such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.},{},{""ko"":D09783,""name"":Tofacitinib citrate}]"

In most patients, the disease has a relapsing-remitting course during the first years. Within 10 years, approximately 50% of patients progress to SPMS. The aetiology of MS is not well understood, but it is likely multifactorial, combining both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially.

ERD can manifest in a wide range of symptoms which can be subdivided into typical, atypical, and extraesophageal symptoms. Typical symptoms include heartburn and acid regurgitation which have high specificity but low sensitivity for GERD. Atypical symptoms such as epigastric pain, dyspepsia, nausea, bloating, and belching may be suggestive of GERD but may overlap with other conditions in the differential diagnosis. Lastly, there are various extraesophageal symptoms including chronic cough, asthma, laryngitis, and dental erosions. In a small but important minority, complications of peptic oesophagitis may occur including oesophageal strictures, Barrett's oesophagus, and rarely oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Hiatus hernia is statistically associated with GERD, the presence of which is relevant to surgical treatment. The diagnosis is typically made by a combination of clinical symptoms, response to acid suppression, as well as objective testing with upper endoscopy and esophageal pH monitoring.

"[{""ko"":H01892,""name"":Peripheral T cell lymphoma,""description"":Peripheral T cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are a group of rare lymphomas originating from mature (i.e., post-thymic or 'peripheral') T lymphocytes and NK cells. With regard to the current WHO classification, leukemic, cutaneous, nodal, and extranodal PTCL are distinguished. The most common subtypes worldwide are the nodal T cell lymphomas. In the nodal T cell lymphomas, the major subtypes are PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and ALK-negative ALCL. Novel approaches are gradually clarifying the molecular pathogenesis of PTCLs. ALK gene translocation and dual specificity phosphatase 22 (DUSP22) gene translocation are seen in ALK-positive ALCL and ALK-negative ALCL, respectively.

Castleman disease is unique in that dysregulated secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays a central pathogenetic role, although the exact events precipitating the oversecretion of IL-6 are unknown. Recently, two antibody-based therapeutics targeting components of the IL-6/IL-6R complex have been approved for the treatment of Castleman disease.

The term thyrotoxicosis is not synonymous with hyperthyroidism. Thyrotoxicosis is defined as the clinical syndrome of hypermetabolism resulting from increased thyroid hormone levels, irrespective of the source. The causes of hyperthyroidism include Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and solitary toxic adenoma. Less common causes of hyperthyroidism include thyrotropin-induced thyrotoxicosis and trophoblastic tumours. The causes of thyrotoxicosis without hyperthyroidism are less common and generally transient. In patients with silent thyroiditis, post-partum thyroiditis, or subacute painful thyroiditis, the destruction of thyrocytes leads to release of preformed hormones into the circulation. Drug-induced thyrotoxicosis has the same pathogenic mechanism as thyroiditis. Exogenous thyrotoxicosis develops after ingestion of excessive amounts of thyroid hormone, and is associated with low serum thyroglobulin concentrations. Patients of hyperthyroidism/thyrotoxicosis usually have fatigue, nervousness or anxiety, weight loss, palpitations, and heat sensitivity. Clinical findings almost always include tachycardia, warm moist skin, the presence of an enlarged thyroid, and a slight tremor. The three options for treating patients with hyperthyroidism are antithyroid drugs (ATDs), radioactive iodine ablation, and surgery. All three therapeutic options would be effective in the treatment of patients with Graves' disease, whereas patients with toxic adenoma or toxic multinodular goiter should have either radioactive iodine therapy or surgery, since these patients rarely go into remission.

"[{""ko"":H01873,""name"":Obliterative bronchiolitis,""description"":Obliterative bronchiolitis (OB), also known as bronchiolitis obliterans, is a rare but serious condition resulting in progressive and irreversible airway obstruction. This disease is the result of injury to the respiratory and terminal bronchioles from a wide variety of potential causes. Although the pathogenesis of OB remains poorly understood, it seems clear that a multifaceted process of inflammation and resultant fibrotic transition occurs, resulting in airflow limitation and development of disease. Although OB has been described in all age groups, the frequency of underlying causes and potential prognoses are different for children and adults. For example, OB in children is most often seen following a severe lower-respiratory-tract infection, usually of adenovirus, whereas OB in adults is more commonly associated with occupational inhalation injuries, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and autoimmune disorders. In lung transplant recipients, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome is the major cause of death after the first year of transplantation and is a form of allograft rejection. There is no uniformly accepted treatment protocol for patients with OB. Many patients are tried on corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants based on anecdotal evidence of improvement.

Mutations in the type II bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor (BMPR)-II are now considered to be the genetic basis for familial PPH and ~30% of cases of sporadic PPH. BMPs are members of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily and affect intracellular signalling via Smads and mitogen-activated protein kinases. It has been shown that missense mutations of cysteine residues in the extracellular or kinase domain of BMPR2 result in intracellular localisation of the mutated receptor and negligible Smad signalling.},{},{""ko"":D00074,""name"":Nitric oxide}]"

Clinically, it is defined as arthritis of unknown origin that starts before the age of 16, and persists for at least 6 weeks. Next to a certain genetic predisposition, environmental factors play a role leading to a chronic inflammatory response. JIA is not a single disorder but consists of a heterogeneous group of auto-immune inflammatory diseases. It has variable rates in course and activity of disease. Based on 6 months of clinical symptoms and global prognostic factors, the following clinical subtypes of JIA are recognized: systemic JIA, oligoarthritis, RF-negative polyarthritis, RF-positive polyarthritis, psoriatic JIA, enthesitis- related arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis. Systemic JIA, also known as Still's disease, is a subtype with strong systemic clinical symptoms. Patients with systemic JIA have, in addition to arthritis, prominent symptoms of systemic inflammation such as spiking fever, rash, pericarditis, peritonitis, lymphadenopathy and organomegaly. A severe and often life-threatening complication occurring in 10-30% of patients with systemic JIA is macrophage activation syndrome. Polymorphisms in the IL6 and in the MIF gene have been found to be associated with susceptibility to the disorder.

"[{""ko"":H00901,""name"":Cystinuria,""description"":Cystinuria is a inherited disorder of re-absorptive transport of cystine and the dibasic amino acids ornithine, arginine and lysine in the proximal tubule and small intestine. Diagnostically, urinary levels of dibasic amino acids lysine, arginine, and ornithine, and most prominently, of cystine are constantly elevated. Plasma levels of these amino acids in general are at the lower end of the normal range. Patients with cystinuria often present with nephro- or urolithiasis at almost at any age with a clear preference in childhood due to elevated urinary cystine. Early diagnosis is important, as it allows prevention or diminution of kidney stones. Mutations in either interacting subunit SLC3A1 (rBAT) or SLC7A9 (b0,+AT) cause cystinuria. Cystinuria due to mutations in SLC3A1 is an autosomal recessive trait, whereas mutations in SLC7A9 can be seen as an autosomal dominant trait.},{},{""ko"":D01430,""name"":Tiopronin}]"

Such presentation activates predominantly CD4 T cells. A direct cytotoxic T-cell attack on graft cells can be made only by T cells that recognize the graft MHC molecules directly. Nontheless, T cells with indirect allospecificity can contribute to graft rejection by activating macrophages, which cause tissue injury and fibrosis, and are also likely to be important in the development of an alloantibody response to graft.},{},{""ko"":D03222,""name"":Belatacept}]"

It is associated with a higher risk of developing testicular tumors in adulthood. Studies in humans have investigated the possibility that mutations in the INSL3 gene are the cause of cryptorchidism. It has shown that INSL3 is involved in testicular descent, however, mutations of this gene are not a frequent cause of cryptorchidism.},{},{""ko"":D06087,""name"":Testosterone undecanoate}]"

Past asbestos exposure represents the major risk factor for MPM, as the link between asbestos fibres and MPM has been largely proved by epidemiological and experimental studies. Recently, simian virus 40 (SV40) has been implicated in the aetiology of MPM. The accumulation of numerous clonal chromosomal deletions in most MMs suggests a multistep process of tumorigenesis, characterized by the loss and/or inactivation of multiple tumor suppressor genes (TSGs). Cytogenetic and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analyses of MMs have demonstrated frequent deletions of specific sites within chromosome arms 1p, 3p, 6q, 9p, 13q, 15q, and 22q. Furthermore, TSGs within two of these regions, i.e., p16/CDKN2A-p14ARF at 9p21 and NF2 at 22q12, are frequently altered in MMs. Mutations of the p53 gene (TP53) are occasionally observed in MMs.},{},{""ko"":D06503,""name"":Pemetrexed sodium hydrate}]"

Because only a minority of patients (around 10-15%) with gastroesophageal reflux disease have BE, additional factors that play important roles in determining the development of BE must concur. Another frequent association with BE, is represented by nitrate, an increased age, Caucasian race, male sex and hiatal hernia.

"[{""ko"":H00243,""name"":Hyperkalemic distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA type 4),""description"":Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is characterized by metabolic acidosis, a severe disturbance of extracellular pH homeostasis, due to renal impaired acid excretion. Type 4 RTA is a heterogeneous group of disorders associated with hyperkalemia due to aldosterone deficiency or impairment in aldosterone molecular signaling. Primary pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1) is characterized by salt-wasting, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis in the presence of markedly elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration. In the autosomal dominant form, aldosterone resistance is due to heterozygous mutations in the mineralocorticoid receptor gene. In the autosomal recessive form, aldosterone resistance is caused by loss-of-function homozygous mutations in the genes encoding one of the three constitutive subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma) of the epithelial Na+ channel (SCNN1A, SCNN1B, and SCNN1G). Other inherited cause of type 4 RTA includes hyperkalaemia associated with hypertension and low or normal levels of plasma aldosterone. This syndrome is called pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 (PHA2), or Gordon's syndrome, which results in a renal aldosterone resistance. Mutations in the genes encoding WNK1 and WNK4 kinases (WNK1 and WNK4), which regulate ion-transportors on renal tubules, were identified in patients with PHA2. Acquired hyperkalemic RTA is observed in the context of mineralocorticoid deficiency, systemic lupus erythematosus, and AIDS nephropathy. It is also often seen in a number of tubulointerstitial renal diseases. Finally, a great number of drugs may induce hyperkalemic RTA.},{},{""ko"":D01203,""name"":Sodium bicarbonate}]"

Since BMD values fall progressively with age, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age. It has been estimated that approximately 50% of all women will have osteoporosis by the age of 80. Studies in twins and families indicate that genetic factors play an important role in the regulation of BMD and other determinants of osteoporotic fracture risk. Osteoporosis is a polygenic disorder, determined by the effects of several genes, each with relatively modest effects. Population-based studies and case-control studies have similarly identified polymorphisms in several candidate genes that have been associated with bone mass or osteoporotic fracture, including the vitamin D receptor, oestrogen receptor and collagen gene.

Its clinical presentation is variable and ranges from isolated skin or bone disease to a life-threatening multisystem condition. Historically, it has been hypothesized that the disease originated from epidermal Langerhans cells. However, new evidence supports a model in which LCH occurs as a consequence of a misguided differentiation programme of myeloid dendritic cell precursors. In LCH, there is a very high frequency of activating mutations in MAPK signaling pathway genes, most notably BRAF-V600E, as well as MAP2K1. Genetic, molecular and functional data implicate activation of the MAPK (ERK) signalling pathway at critical stages in myeloid differentiation as an essential and universal driver of LCH pathology.},{},{""ko"":D01068,""name"":Vinblastine sulfate}]"

"[{""ko"":H00004,""name"":Chronic myeloid leukemia,""description"":Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder of a pluripotent stem cell. The natural history of CML has a triphasic clinical course comprising of an initial chronic phase (CP), which is characterized by expansion of functionally normal myeloid cells, followed by an accelerated phase (AP) and finally a more aggressive blast phase (BP), with loss of terminal differentiation capacity. On the cellular level, CML is associated with a specific chromosome abnormality, the t(9; 22) reciprocal translocation that forms the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. The Ph chromosome is the result of a molecular rearrangement between the c-ABL proto-oncogene on chromosome 9 and the BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22. The BCR/ABL fusion gene encodes p210 BCR/ABL, an oncoprotein, which, unlike the normal p145 c-Abl, has constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. While fusion of c-ABL and BCR is believed to be the primary cause of the chronic phase of CML, progression to blast crisis requires other molecular changes. Common secondary abnormalities include mutations in TP53, RB, and p16/INK4A, or overexpression of genes such as EVI1.

"[{""ko"":H01522,""name"":Zollinger-Ellison syndrome,""description"":Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) is a rare endocrinopathy caused by tumors of the pancreas and duodenum. These tumors, called gastrinomas, release gastrin to produce large amounts of acid that result in severe gastroesophageal peptic ulcer disease and diarrhea. Most ZES cases are sporadic, but about over 20 percent are caused by an inherited genetic disorder called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (see H00247).

"[{""ko"":H02398,""name"":COVID-19,""description"":Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious respiratory infection that is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 infects alveolar epithelial cells [mainly alveolar epithelial type 2 (AEC2) cells] through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Upon the occupancy of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2, the increased serum level of free Angiotensin II (Ang II) due to a reduction of ACE2-mediated degradation promotes activation of the NF-kappa B pathway via Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R), followed by  interleukin-6 (IL-6) production. SARS-CoV-2 also activates the innate immune system; macrophage stimulation triggers the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, and the 'cytokine storm', which results in systemic inflammatory response syndrome and multiple organ failure. The combined effects of complement activation, dysregulated neutrophilia, endothelial injury, and hypercoagulability appear to be intertwined to drive the severe features of COVID-19.},{},{""ko"":D11472,""name"":Remdesivir}]"

T cell transformation is a multi-step process in which different genetic alterations cooperate to alter the normal mechanisms that control cell growth, proliferation, survival, and differentiation during thymocyte development. In this context, constitutive activation of NOTCH1 signaling is the most prominent oncogenic pathway in T cell transformation. In addition, T-ALLs characteristically show the translocation and aberrant expression of transcription factor oncogenes. These oncogenic transcription factors include T-cell leukaemia homeobox protein 1 (TLX1 also known as HOX11), TLX3 (HOX11L2), LYL1, TAL1 and MLL.},{},{""ko"":D00287,""name"":Cyclophosphamide}]"

Mevalonate kinase is located at the beginning of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway compromising the biosynthesis of nonsterol isoprenes in addition to cholesterol. Patients of MVA show the symptoms, including dysmorphic features, cataracts, neurologic symptoms. The majority of patients with HIDS experience only recurrent febrile crises, without any neurologic abnormalities or dysmorphic features. Mevalonic kinase activity in HIDS patients is generally in the range of 5-15% of normal as compared to 0-4% in MVA.},{},{""ko"":D09315,""name"":Canakinumab}]"

"[{""ko"":H01450,""name"":Obsessive-compulsive disorder,""description"":Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric disorder characterized by recurrent, intrusive and disturbing thoughts as well as by repetitive stereotypic behaviors. OCD is a complex disorder and its pathogenesis is most likely influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Although more than 140 candidate gene studies have been conducted, the findings have been inconclusive due to small sample size and few study replications. Many studies suggest that abnormal serotonergic neurotransmission is one of the most consistent biological findings in OCD. Studies have also reported dopaminergic abnormalities in the basal ganglia and nucleus accumbens, as well as altered glutamate transmission. First line treatments for this disorder are cognitive behavioral therapy (exposure and response prevention) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In recent years, one of the promising novel treatment strategies developed to improve the efficacy of treatment for patients with OCD is acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). Recent studies have suggested that age of onset is an important factor in subtyping OCD. Early-onset OCD has been proposed to be associated with greater symptom severity, a higher prevalence of tic-related disorders, a more familial form of the condition, and a greater prevalence of psychiatry disorders in first-degree relatives as compared to late-onset OCD.},{},{""ko"":D00824,""name"":Fluvoxamine maleate}]"

Many studies suggest that abnormal serotonergic neurotransmission is one of the most consistent biological findings in OCD. Studies have also reported dopaminergic abnormalities in the basal ganglia and nucleus accumbens, as well as altered glutamate transmission. First line treatments for this disorder are cognitive behavioral therapy (exposure and response prevention) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In recent years, one of the promising novel treatment strategies developed to improve the efficacy of treatment for patients with OCD is acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). Recent studies have suggested that age of onset is an important factor in subtyping OCD. Early-onset OCD has been proposed to be associated with greater symptom severity, a higher prevalence of tic-related disorders, a more familial form of the condition, and a greater prevalence of psychiatry disorders in first-degree relatives as compared to late-onset OCD.},{},{""ko"":D00823,""name"":Fluoxetine hydrochloride}]"

About 80% of AMLs are sporadic and not associated with any genetic syndrome. Remaining cases are associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). The pathogenesis of TSC is thought to result from mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes that encode the proteins tuberin and hamartin, respectively. These proteins interact with each other to form heterodimers, whose most important role is inhibition of the mTOR pathway. Loss of inhibition of mTORC1 leads to increased activation of this pathway and the formation of the lesions characteristic of TSC.

ALK-positive ALCL, by definition overexpresses an ALK-fusion gene, typically via t(2;5)(p23;35) which fuses the ALK gene on chromosome 2 with the nucleophosmin (NPM) gene on chromosome 5, resulting in a NPM-ALK chimeric protein with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. ALK-negative ALCLs lack ALK rearrangements and their genetic and clinical features are more variable. A subset of ALK-negative ALCLs has rearrangements at 6p25.3 involving DUSP22, a gene encoding a dual-specificity phosphatase that inhibits T-cell receptor signaling.

If present after the age of 3 month, this condition is known as PDA. PDA can cause significant problems, especially in premature infants. It can be associated with an increased incidence of chronic lung disease, intraventricular hemorrhage, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Clinicians may choose to treat the PDA in an attempt to minimize the risk of these complications. Prostaglandin inhibition using indomethacin or ibuprofen is the standard strategy to close the DA. Surgical closure of the DA is an alternative option. Autosomal dominant forms of PDA caused by mutation in the TFAP2B and PRDM6 gene has been reported.

"[{""ko"":H00745,""name"":Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HyperPP),""description"":The periodic paralyses are a group of autosomal-dominant disorders of skeletal muscle sodium, potassium, and calcium channel genes. They are characterized by episodes of muscle weakness associated with variations in serum potassium concentration. Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HyperPP) is caused by gain-of-function mutations in the alpha-subunit of the skeletal muscle voltage-gated sodium channel, Nav1.4. However, 20% of cases remain genetically undefined, suggesting genetic heterogeneity. HyperPP is characterized by attacks of flaccid limb paralysis or, rarely, weakness of the eye and throat muscles. Triggers for these attacks include ingestion of potassium-rich food, rest after strenuous exercise, and cold exposure.},{},{""ko"":D00518,""name"":Dichlorphenamide}]"

Although the precise pathomechanisms of pemphigus have not yet been fully elucidated, recent studies have shown that desmosome disassembling involves not only the direct inhibition of desmosome formation caused by IgGs, but also desmosome remodeling. Pemphigus can be divided into non-inflammatory types, which are the major and common types, and inflammatory types, which are much less common and include necrolytic (apoptotic) type. Non-inflammatory pemphigus includes two types: pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF). The former is caused by autoantibodies to desmoglein (Dsg) 3 only or to both Dsg1 and Dsg3 and generates clinically multiple flaccid blisters and erosions due to acantholysis at the lower, typically along the suprabasal, layers in the epidermis and mucous membranes. The latter is caused by autoantibodies to Dsg1 and clinically characterized by very fragile superficial blisters and large leafy scales due to acantholysis at the granular cell layer in the epidermis, but not observed in the mucous membranes. Inflammatory types of pemphigus include pemphigus herpetiformis (PH), pemphigus vegetans (PVeg) and the so-called paraneoplastic pemphigus (PP). Because pemphigus is an autoimmune disease, the most common treatment is the administration of oral steroids to inhibit antibody production, combined with the use of topical agents to prevent infection, protect the eroded areas and promote epithelialization. Other concomitant therapy can include the use of immunosuppressants, plasma exchange, and the administration of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).},{},{""ko"":D00979,""name"":Methylprednisolone acetate}]"

It is accompanied by increased osmolarity of the tear film and subacute inflammation of the ocular surface. Dry eye disease is subdivided into two forms, aqueous insufficiency (tear deficiency) and hyperevaporative (increased evaporation). However, mixed forms are common. Aqueous insufficiency is divided into two main groups: Sjogren's syndrome-related dry eye and non-Sjogren's syndrome-related dry eye (which includes the use of systemic medication). Dry eye in Sjogren's syndrome (an autoimmune disease) [DS:H01502] is often severe and requires more aggressive treatment. Evapourative dry eye is most commonly a result of meibomian gland dysfunction. Tests used to diagnose dry eye disease and to assess efficacy of treatments in clinical trials include the following: measurement of tear film break-up time (the interval between the individual's last complete blink and the break up of the tear film) using fluorescein (shortened in dry eye disease), evaluation of tear quantity with Schirmer's test (using a strip of filter paper placed under the lower eyelid), assessment of corneal and conjunctival epithelium integrity using stains and dyes, and evaluation of meibomian glands. Artificial tears of various kinds are recommended if the symptoms are mild. Lid hygiene is helpful in the treatment of hyperevaporative dry eye, while collagen or silicon plugs can be used for partial occlusion of the efferent lacrimal ducts to treat severe hyposecretory dry eye. The benefit of long-term topical anti-inflammatory treatment of moderate or severe dry eye disease with corticosteroids or cyclosporine A eye drops has been documented in clinical trials on a high evidence level.

The symptoms include fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and cytopenia. Homozygous and heterozygous gene mutations of perforin, the major immune cytotoxic protein, were detected with frequency between 15% and 50% of all FHPL patients. UNC13D is the second gene associated with FHPL. The encoded protein (Munc13-4) is important for cytolytic granule exocytosis. Recently a third FHPL associated gene on chromosome 6q24 with mutations in STX11 was identified. The encoded protein, t-SNARE syntaxin 11, also plays a role in intracellular trafficking, but its precise role is not known.},{},{""ko"":D11120,""name"":Emapalumab}]"

The findings derived from high-throughput sequencing combined with previous knowledge have led to an emerging molecular classification of leiomyomas, suggesting that there are several distinct pathogenic pathways involved in leiomyoma formation. The evidence points to at least 4 molecular subclasses: leiomyomas with MED12 mutation, FH inactivation, HMGA2 overexpression, and COL4A6-COL4A5 deletion. While it is thought that the initial events that trigger leiomyoma tumorigenesis involves somatic mutations, it is evident that the development and growth of leiomyoma are highly dependent on ovarian steroid hormones, in particular, progesterone.},{},{""ko"":D00989,""name"":Leuprolide acetate}]"

Cigarette smoking has been implicated as the main etiology of the disease. Although Buerger's disease has a worldwide distribution, it is more prevalent in the Middle East and Far East and classically develops in male smokers younger than 45 years. There may be a predisposition to development of Buerger's disease, although no gene has been identified to date. The most common symptom is pain at rest and claudication in the affected hands or feet. Other symptoms include cold insensitivity, diminished peripheral pulses, cyanosis, skin atrophy, and reduced hair growth. As the disease progresses, patients will develop ischemic ulcerations and eventually gangrene. Abstinence from smoking is the definitive treatment to prevent disease progression. Medical line of treatment with vasodilators, pentoxyfylline, and cilostazol may help improve pain-free walking distance but cannot prevent disease progression. Surgical treatment in form of revascularization and sympathectomy increases peripheral blood flow and decreases the rate of amputations.

While the pathogenesis of CTEPH is not entirely understood, the primary pathophysiology appears to be related to an initial thrombotic event followed by both inadequate thrombus resolution and secondary arteriopathy. Several risk factors for development of CTEPH have been found, including the size of the initial PE, splenectomy, chronic inflammatory conditions, and indwelling catheters and cardiac pacemaker leads. There is however an increased incidence of elevated factor VIII levels in CTEPH, and this finding persists after treatment. However, none of these findings explain the development of CTEPH in the majority of patients affected by this disease.},{},{""ko"":D09572,""name"":Riociguat}]"

The translocation causes the juxtaposition of the PAX-5 gene to the IgH locus in the opposite direction of transcription, resulting in an 11-fold over-expression of PAX-5 mRNA.},{},{""ko"":D04489,""name"":Ibritumomab tiuxetan}]"

Two major mechanisms of genomic instability have been identified in sporadic CRC progression. The first, known as chromosomal instability (CIN), results from a series of genetic changes that involve the activation of oncogenes such as K-ras and inactivation of TSG such as p53, DCC/Smad4, and APC. The second, known as microsatellite instability (MSI), results from inactivation of the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1 and/or MSH2 by hypermethylation of their promoter, and secondary mutation of genes with coding microsatellites, such as transforming growth factor receptor II (TGF-RII) and BAX. Hereditary syndromes have germline mutations in specific genes (mutation in the tumour suppressor gene APC on chromosome 5q in FAP, mutated DNA mismatch repair genes in HNPCC).},{},{""ko"":D01061,""name"":Irinotecan hydrochloride}]"
"[{""ko"":H01596,""name"":Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome,""description"":The Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune disease of neuromuscular transmission in which autoantibodies against the P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) at the presynaptic nerve terminal play a major role in decreasing quantal release of acetylcholine (ACh). Clinically, LEMS patients suffer from characteristic muscle weakness and autonomic symptoms. The underlying cause of LEMS in slightly more than half of all patients is small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) [DS:H00013]. The nerve terminal and carcinoma cells apparently share a common antigen (VGCC), suggesting an immunological cross-reactivity that may lead to the neurological abnormality. Cancer therapy is the priority for these patients. As for the remaining cases, no antibodies to P/Q-type VGCCs have been found in 10-15% of patients with LEMS. The fact that these seronegative patients positively respond to immunotherapy leads to the presumption that antibodies to other proteins might play a role in LEMS. Diagnosis of LEMS is ascertained on the basis of clinical symptoms and is further supported by electrophysiological and serological tests. The clinical triad in LEMS consists of weakness predominantly affecting proximal muscle groups, autonomic dysfunctions, and areflexia. Besides oncological treatment in case of case of SCLC-LEMS, treatment is based on symptomatic and semi-specific immunosuppressive therapy.},{},{""ko"":D10228,""name"":Amifampridine}]"

"[{""ko"":H01703,""name"":Eating Disorders,""description"":Eating disorders, which include anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge eating disorder (BED), are disorders defined by disturbances in eating behavior. Anorexia nervosa (AN) is the oldest recognized eating disorder. The salient features of this eating disorder are a relentless pursuit of thinness, accompanied by a fear of becoming fat despite being markedly underweight. In women, anorexia nervosa is associated with global endocrine dysregulation, including hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction and alterations in adipokine and appetite regulating hormone levels. Bulimia nervosa (BN) is defined by eating behaviors that include episodes of binge eating which are followed by recurrent self-induced vomiting performed in an attempt to avoid weight gain from the caloric overload. Binge eating disorder (BED) is currently characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating occurring at least twice a week for 6 months or longer. In contrast to bulimia nervosa, there are no inappropriate compensatory behaviors such as vomiting. Eating disorders frequently develop during adolescence or early adulthood, but some studies have reported their onset during childhood or later in adulthood. There is growing evidence supporting a multifactorial etiology that includes genetic, neurochemical, and physiological components for eating disorders above and beyond the more conventional theories based on psychological and sociocultural factors. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a critical role in regulating nerves in the brain. Recent studies have provided evidence that BDNF also plays a role in regulating eating behaviors. In addition, an association between the BDNF gene polymorphism and eating disorders has been demonstrated. Other genetic risk factors for eating disorders has also been reported.},{},{""ko"":D00823,""name"":Fluoxetine hydrochloride}]"

It is initiated by the deposition of immunoglobulins and formation of immune complexes in the glomerular and tubulo-interstitial compartments of the kidney.

"[{""ko"":H00019,""name"":Pancreatic cancer,""description"":Infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma is the most common malignancy of the pancreas. When most investigators use the term 'pancreatic cancer' they are referring to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Normal duct epithelium progresses to infiltrating cancer through a series of histologically defined precursors (PanINs). The overexpression of HER-2/neu and activating point mutations in the K-ras gene occur early, inactivation of the p16 gene at an intermediate stage, and the inactivation of p53, SMAD4, and BRCA2 occur relatively late. Activated K-ras engages multiple effector pathways. Although EGF receptors are conventionally regarded as upstream activators of RAS proteins, they can also act as RAS signal transducers via RAS-induced autocrine activation of the EGFR family ligands. Moreover, PDA shows extensive genomic instability and aneuploidy. Telomere attrition and mutations in p53 and BRCA2 are likely to contribute to these phenotypes. Inactivation of the SMAD4 tumour suppressor gene leads to loss of the inhibitory influence of the transforming growth factor-beta signalling pathway.},{},{""ko"":D01155,""name"":Gemcitabine hydrochloride}]"

The best characterized of the clonal molecular defects implicated in myeloproliferative variant HES is the 800-kb interstitial deletion on chromosome 4q12 resulting in the fusion of 2 distinct genes, Fip1-like 1 (FIP1L1) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-a (PDGFRA), leading to the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion kinase. PDGFR is a membrane-bound tyrosine kinase receptor and the fusion PDGFRA kinase has constitutive/unregulated tyrosine kinase activity. The lymphocytic HES variant is associated with T-cell clones producing interleukin-5 (IL-5) and can evolve into lymphoma. While myeloproliferative and lymphocytic HES are well established and permit elimination of the term, idiopathic, to these varieties, most HES patients do not fall into these categories and are classified as complex.},{},{""ko"":D01441,""name"":Imatinib mesylate}]"
